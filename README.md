meta-clutter
============

meta-clutter provides clutter-related recipes and aims to track upstream
development in a timely fashion.

meta-clutter depends only on oe-core. Branch naming follows the normal OE
conventions, i.e., the master is meant to be used with oe-core master, while
the dylan branch is meant to be used with the oe-core dylan branch, etc.
